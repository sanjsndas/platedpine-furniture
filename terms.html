            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: July 9, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>Welcome to PlatedPine! These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the PlatedPine website (www.platedpine.com) and all related services, products, content, and applications (collectively, the "Service"). Please read these Terms carefully before using our Service. By accessing or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By using the PlatedPine Service, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into this agreement and that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and "you" and "your" in these Terms refer to that entity. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>PlatedPine reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>

            <h2>3. Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by this reference. Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to understand our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>

            <h2>4. Account Registration and Security</h2>
            <h3>4.1. Account Creation</h3>
            <p>To access certain features of the Service, you may be required to register for an account. When you register, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by the registration form. You agree to maintain and promptly update your account information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.</p>

            <h3>4.2. Account Security</h3>
            <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify PlatedPine immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. PlatedPine will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>

            <h3>4.3. Prohibited Uses</h3>
            <p>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).</p>

            <h2>5. Product Information and Orders</h2>
            <h3>5.1. Product Descriptions</h3>
            <p>PlatedPine strives to be as accurate as possible in the description of our products. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other content of the Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Natural wood products, including pine, inherently exhibit variations in grain, color, and texture; such variations are not considered defects. Product images on the website are for illustrative purposes only and may differ slightly from the actual product due to screen settings, lighting, and natural material variations.</p>

            <h3>5.2. Pricing and Availability</h3>
            <p>All prices displayed on the Service are in Indian Rupees (INR) unless otherwise specified and are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue products at any time without prior notice. While we strive to ensure accurate pricing, errors may occur. In the event of a pricing error, PlatedPine reserves the right to cancel any orders placed at the incorrect price, even if the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is cancelled, PlatedPine will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price.</p>

            <h3>5.3. Order Acceptance</h3>
            <p>Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. PlatedPine reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.</p>

            <h3>5.4. Custom Orders</h3>
            <p>For "Made-to-Order" products, specific terms regarding dimensions, finishes, and customization details will be confirmed during the order process. Once a custom order is confirmed, it may not be cancelled or altered, and is generally non-refundable, unless there is a manufacturing defect or significant deviation from the agreed-upon specifications.</p>

            <h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>All payments for products purchased through the Service must be made through the payment methods offered on our website. You represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of the payment method. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. PlatedPine uses third-party payment processors; your payment information is handled directly by these secure processors and is not stored on our servers.</p>

            <h2>7. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
            <p>Shipping and delivery terms, including estimated delivery times and costs, will be provided at the time of purchase. Delivery dates are estimates only and are not guaranteed. PlatedPine is not responsible for delays caused by shipping carriers, customs, or other factors beyond our reasonable control. Risk of loss and title for items purchased from PlatedPine pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</p>

            <h2>8. Returns, Refunds, and Warranty</h2>
            <h3>8.1. Returns and Refunds</h3>
            <p>Our return and refund policy is detailed on our website. Generally, standard products may be returned within a specified period (e.g., 14 days) from delivery, provided they are in new, unused condition and in their original packaging. Custom-made products are typically non-returnable and non-refundable unless there is a manufacturing defect. Shipping costs for returns are generally the responsibility of the customer.</p>

            <h3>8.2. Warranty</h3>
            <p>PlatedPine offers a 10-year structural warranty on all our furniture, covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal household use. This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, damage caused by improper assembly or maintenance, misuse, accidents, or natural variations in wood. For full details, please refer to our Furniture Care Guarantee section on the website or contact customer support.</p>
