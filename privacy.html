            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated: July 9, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>At PlatedPine, we are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how PlatedPine ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects the information we gather from you when you visit our website, make a purchase, interact with our services, or communicate with us. We understand the importance of transparency and aim to provide you with a clear understanding of our practices. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction to Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your trust is paramount to us. In an increasingly digital world, the privacy of your personal data has never been more critical. PlatedPine is not just about crafting beautiful, sustainable furniture; it's also about building a relationship with our customers based on respect and integrity. This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about our data handling practices in a comprehensive manner, detailing what information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used, and the measures we take to safeguard it. We encourage you to read this policy carefully to understand our approach to your privacy. We regularly review and update our privacy practices to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws and to reflect changes in our operations.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect various types of information to provide and improve our services, process your orders, and enhance your overall experience with PlatedPine. The information we collect can be broadly categorized into two types: information you provide to us directly, and information we collect automatically.</p>

            <h3>2.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
            <p>When you interact with us, you may provide us with personal information directly. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account on our website, we collect your name, email address, password, and sometimes your phone number.

Please note that we do not store full credit card numbers on our servers; these are processed securely by third-party payment gateways compliant with industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Information:</strong> If you contact us via email, phone, live chat (including WhatsApp support), or social media, we collect the content of your communications, your contact details, and any information you choose to provide. This helps us to respond to your inquiries, provide customer support, and improve our service quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization Details:</strong> When you use our "Made-to-Order" service or "Custom Name Engraving," you provide specific details about your preferences, dimensions, finishes, and text for engraving. This information is crucial for fulfilling your custom order accurately.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Preferences:</strong> If you subscribe to our newsletter or marketing communications, we collect your email address and any preferences you indicate regarding the types of content you wish to receive.</li>
                <li><strong>Survey and Feedback Information:</strong> From time to time, we may invite you to participate in surveys or provide feedback on our products and services.

            </ul>

            <h3>2.2. Information We Collect Automatically</h3>

This information is crucial for analyzing website traffic, identifying popular products, and improving navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> In some cases, we may infer your approximate geographical location from your IP address. This helps us to tailor content, pricing, and shipping options relevant to your region.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your interactions with our website.

                <li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.</li>
                <li>Protect against legal liability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.4. With Your Consent</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with third parties for any purpose where you have given us explicit consent to do so. For example, if you choose to participate in a joint promotion with a partner company, we may share your information as described in that specific promotion.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your personal information is a top priority for PlatedPine. We implement a robust set of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt data during transmission between your browser and our servers, particularly for sensitive information like payment details.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to your personal information is restricted to authorized employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses in our systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect and retain personal information that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Our employees receive regular training on data privacy and security best practices to ensure they understand their responsibilities in protecting your information.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> We carefully vet our third-party service providers to ensure they also maintain high standards of data security and compliance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite our best efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect your personal information, such as using strong, unique passwords and being cautious about sharing personal details online.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The specific retention period will vary depending on the type of data and the purpose for which it was collected.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account remains active. If you close your account, we may retain certain data for a limited period to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</li>
                <li><strong>Order Information:</strong> We retain order information for a period necessary to fulfill the order, process returns, handle warranty claims (e.g., 10-year structural warranty), and for tax and accounting purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Preferences:</strong> We retain your marketing preferences until you opt-out or unsubscribe from our communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Automatically collected usage data is typically retained for a shorter period, unless it is aggregated or anonymized for analytical purposes, in which case it may be retained indefinitely.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once the retention period expires, we securely delete or anonymize your personal information.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>

                <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
